Basic Graph Functions
- Scroll: Navigate through the graph to view different time frames.
- Zoom: Zoom in and out to focus on specific data points or get an overview.
- Filter: Apply filters to display specific parameters or ranges.
- Overlay: Overlay multiple parameters on the same graph for comparative analysis.
- Incident Recognition (MVP)
  - EcuLogger includes an early-stage (MVP) feature for incident recognition, which aims to identify and analyze correlations between engine parameters over extended periods.

Engine Parameter Correlation Analysis:
- Tracks and records engine parameters continuously to understand their relationships.
- Determines the expected behavior of one parameter based on others by analyzing patterns and trends.
- Identifies which parameters have the most significant influence on others using intuitive metrics.
  - For example, if throttle position is the primary influencer of air intake pressure, EcuLogger quantifies this relationship, providing a clear measurement of influence.
  - Helps users diagnose issues by revealing how changes in one parameter affect others, offering insights into engine performance and potential problems.
